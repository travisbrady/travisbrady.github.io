      <description>New Stuff in Vowpal Wabbit 8.9.0  Vowpal Wabbit 8.9.0 was released a few weeks ago and includes a ton of interesting new features. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that it&amp;rsquo;s largest new release in my memory having used and followed the project now since 2014. This release shows excellent progress apparently due at least in part to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s increased investment and reliance on the project.
This release seems to focus primarily on algorithm support and offline ease-of-use as opposed to in-production-ease-of-use.</description>
