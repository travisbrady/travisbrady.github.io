      <description>New Stuff in Vowpal Wabbit 8.9.0 Vowpal Wabbit 8.9.0 was released a few weeks ago and includes a ton of interesting new features. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that it&amp;rsquo;s largest new release in my memory having used and followed the project now since 2014. This release shows excellent progress apparently due at least in part to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s increased investment and reliance on the project.
This release seems to focus primarily on algorithm support and offline ease-of-use as opposed to in-production-ease-of-use.</description>

      <description>Worthwhile Practical Papers Interesting papers for folks engaged in building production ML systems primarily for user-facing use cases. This covers things like computational advertising, click estimation, search ranking, bandit-based user experience optimization, recommender systems and other related things.
Ad Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches [link] A well-known paper from a large group a Google sharing details on Google&amp;rsquo;s sponsored search system. I like this paper because it naturally mixes lots of practical lessons about using ML in production with a notable theory contribution (FTRL).</description>

      <description>First post. Mostly just testing for now but thought I&amp;rsquo;d describe a few areas I plan to focus on if I&amp;rsquo;m actually able to continue writing here.
 Simplicity in machine learning Ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with machine learning Quick Surveys of sub-fields within Data Science and Machine Learning Evaluations of software options for certain specific ML applications Reviews of cookies: I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding I plan to review cookies I&amp;rsquo;ll probably also review pizza as well while I&amp;rsquo;m at it Writeups on my cycling training and my dreams of owning a BMC Roadmachine One Coffee: I am far from a pro but I love experimenting and am a fan of the gear from Fellow  </description>
